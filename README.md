Starting with EUNIC App
Culture is a set of values that a society developed through time and imposes on all its new members. Being exposed to other cultures makes any member more aware of the variety of values that humans can come up with. Hopefully people are not complete psycopaths and with time will converge on the values that have shown to make life safe and happy: peace, tolerance, openness, respect for others, intellectual curiosity. EUNIC App (or soon to be called Invisible Cities) hopes to accelerate such process by helping people to realize that it is easy to find and participate in cultural activities in their city and globally, meeting and learning about other's values. We hope that in the long run such exposure can lead to better educated, cultured, tolerant and happy humans.
